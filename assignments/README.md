# Assignment 1

# Assignment 2

## Due Date

This assignment is due five hours before the third live session.

## Overview

An important component of software security is learning to identify vulnerabilities in source code, development processes, usage, and other software aspects. Developers gain exposure to vulnerabilities through their career by seeing vulnerabilities in peer code, learning about vulnerabilities in software, and receiving feedback about vulnerabilities in their own code. Building up experience to be able to effectively spot and fix key vulnerabilities takes time.

This assignment is designed to help you to learn the patterns of vulnerabilities in different software aspects by exposing you to both the creation and identification of vulnerabilities in a variety of code bases. You will both produce demonstrations of real vulnerabilities and try to identify the vulnerabilities created by others. Both production and identification of vulnerabilities can be deceptively challenging - do not understimate the difficulty of this assignment.

## Vulnerabilities to Demonstrate
For this assignment, you need to demonsrate at least two injection attack vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Secrecy
You are required to keep your vulnerability demonstration secret until after it is discussed in class. You may not discuss your vulnerability with any of your peers prior to the due date.

## The Code
You are being provided a code generator that will generate a semi-random Java web application. The code generator is the same one that you used in the first assignment. You will use the generated code as the basis of your solution. You are free to use one of the code bases that you generated in the first assignment as the basis of this one. You must use the unique code randomly generated by your generator. You can not use the code base generated by one of your peers. You will need to dissect and understand this code base and then find a place to create an injection vulnerability.

## Documenting Your Vulnerability
After you have modified the application to create your injection vulnerability, you must document your vulnerability. You must document the vulnerability using the format shown below in a file named vulnerability.md. You should edit the example below to be specific to your code base and vulnerability. You MUST include sample instructions for exploiting the vulnerability via curl. You must describe why the vulnerability is an issue and what to look for in the output of your curl command.

```
# Overview 
This code base demonstrates the following attacks: ....

# Vulnerability 1: Injection Attack

The code includes an injection attack that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
commands into the server via Java's Runtime.exec() mechanism. The vulnerable code
path is as follows:

1. HTTP requests sent to the Foo controller's getBar() method accept a "q" parameter
   on lines 183-192
2. The "q" parameter is concatenated with a String to set the value for the "f" variable
   on line 195
3. The "f" variable is passed to Runtime.exec() on line 197

The vulnerability can be exploited by following the steps below:

1. Using curl, send the following request to the server:
   
   curl -XGET http://localhost:8080/foo/bar -d '; ls'
   
2. The server should send back a String that includes a list of the files in the 
   directory where the server is running, including an entry for "build.gradle", which
   is a sensitive internal file.
3. Arbitrary commands could be substituted for the "q" parameter allowing attacks on 
   the server

# Vulnerability 2: ....
  ...
```

## Submission
To hand-in your assignment, please submit a zip file that includes your vulnerability.md file and your project WITHOUT the bin, build, or node_modules directories.

## Grading
The grade will be based on the following components:

Each vulnerability demonstration will be assessed based on the following criteria:

(20pts) The vulnerability listed is correctly demonstrated
(20pts) The vulnerability demonstration is well integrated into the functionality of the application
(10pts) The vulnerability is correctly documented in the vulnerability.md file
(10pts) The vulnerability can be reproduced from the provided documentation
(10pts) The lines of source code that create the vulnerability are described in sufficient detail
(30pts) Overall quality of the vulnerability demonstrations and their documentation
You should preference high-quality demonstrations with excellent documentation.

# Assignment 3

## Due Date

This assignment is due five hours before the sixth live session.

You will both produce demonstrations of real vulnerabilities and try to identify the vulnerabilities created by others. Both production and identification of vulnerabilities can be deceptively challenging - do not understimate the difficulty of this assignment.

## Vulnerabilities to Demonstrate
For this assignment, you need to demonstrate an injection attack, a security misconfiguration, and a vulnerable dependency. You can not reuse any vulnerabilities from a previous assignment. All vulnerabilities must be new, although they may be based on the same idea.Â 

## Vulnerability Secrecy
You are required to keep your vulnerability demonstration secret until after it is discussed in class. You may not discuss your vulnerability with any of your peers prior to the due date.

## The Code
You are being provided a code generator that will generate a semi-random Java web application. The code generator is the same one that you used in the first assignment.
